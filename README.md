# Facial-key-point-detection
## Project introduction
This project is all about recognizing the key points in a given random facial image. The key points on a face can be eyebrows, nose lining, lips lining, etc.  
Facial key point detections are used in security systems, device authentification, employee login control, etc. 
The author has used deep learning approach to develop the software. The application is also capable of detecting the faces in a given image with bounding box. The method of Haar cascade has been used for face detection. It can handle multiple faces in a given input image.
